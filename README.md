# Voice Coil Motor
This is a project for designing and controlling a Voice Coil Motor. 
Voice coil actuators (VCAs) are direct drive, limited motion devices that utilize a permanent magnet field and coil winding (conductor) to produce a force that is proportional to the current applied to the coil. These non-commutated electromagnet devices are used in linear and rotary motion applications that require linear force or torque output, and high acceleration, or high frequency oscillation. Originally used in radio loud speakers, voice coil actuators are gaining popularity in applications where proportional or tight servo control is a necessity.


# Coil Winder
We will build a Coil Winder in order to wind the coil contained in the motor. Some parts are 3D printed and the structure is built with aluminium profiles. The winding movement is produced by two stepper motors, the slider and the winder, both controlled by an Arduino UNO board.
